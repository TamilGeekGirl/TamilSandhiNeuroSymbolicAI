# Tamil Sandhi Library

Tamil is an agglutinative and highly inflectional language. It has a rich morphology and there is a special kind of errors called Sandhi errors that are specific to Tamil and some other Dravidian languages. This paper presents TamilSandhi, an open-source neuro-symbolic framework for identification and correction of Sandhi errors in Tamil. TamilSandhi merges rule-based logic for simple Sandhi rules with neural models for one complex rule, providing precise correction capabilities. The rule-based part of the system has 12 Vallinam (hard consonant) addition rules and 9 Vallinam deletion rules in accordance with ancient Tamil grammar texts such as Tolkappiyam and Nannool. It is about to be published as a PyPi library all of which were successfully tested through a comprehensive suite of 300 unit tests (235 for addition and 65 for deletion. One complex Sandhi rule was formulated as a sequence-to-sequence learning task. A supervised corpus of 10,434 manually annotated sentence pairs—each consisting of an incorrect sentence and its corrected version—was constructed. We fine-tuned three multilingual transformer models known for Tamil support and strong generation capabilities: mBART, mT5, and NLLB. Among them, mBART achieved the best results, with a BLEU score of 99.9 and exact match accuracy of 97.9\%. TamilSandhi is available as a rule-based package on GitHub, with pretrained models and GUI/CLI toolkits planned for a separate release. Its modular, reproducible, and linguistic validity contributes to its significance in the field of Tamil NLP research.
