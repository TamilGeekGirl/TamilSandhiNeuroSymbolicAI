## About repo

This repository accompanies the paper **“TamilSandhi: A Neuro-Symbolic AI Toolkit for Correcting Sandhi Errors in Tamil”** _(to be presented at the AI-2025 Forty-fifth SGAI International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND 16-18 DECEMBER 2025)_

## Abstract of the paper
Tamil is an agglutinative and highly inflectional language with rich morphology. Sandhi errors are a class of spelling mistakes in Tamil that occur at word boundaries due to incorrect insertion or omission of hard consonants. This paper presents TamilSandhi, an open-source neuro-symbolic framework for identifying and correcting such errors. It combines rule-based logic for simple Sandhi rules with neural models for one complex rule. The rule-based system implements 12
Vallinam (hard consonant) addition rules and 8 deletion rules, derived from classical Tamil grammar texts such as _Tolkappiyam_ and _Nannool_. These rules were packaged into a **PyPi library** and validated using a suite of **300 unit tests** (235 for addition, 65 for deletion). To address a complex rule not covered by the rule-based logic, a neural sequence-to-sequence approach was used. A supervised corpus of 10,434 manually annotated sentence pairs, each consisting of an incorrect and corrected version, was created. Three multilingual transformer models—mBART, mT5, and NLLB—were fine-tuned. Among them, **mBART** achieved the best performance, with **a BLEU score of 99.9 and exact match accuracy of 97.9%**. **TamilSandhi** is released as an open-source project on GitHub. Due to its modularity, reproducibility, and linguistic validity, TamilSandhi constitutes a significant contribution to NLP research in a widely used but low-resource language.
