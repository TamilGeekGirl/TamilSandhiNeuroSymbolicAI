# Tamil Sandhi Library

TamilSandhi is an open-source Python library developed for detecting and correcting Sandhi errors in Tamil text. By implementing linguistically grounded rule-based logic for Vallinam (hard consonant) addition and deletion rules, in accordance with ancient Tamil grammar texts such as Tolkappiyam and Nannool, TamilSandhi provides a structured and reproducible foundation for automated Sandhi error detection and correction. The library implements a total of 12 Vallinam addition rules and 9 Vallinam deletion rules, carefully designed based on grammatical prescriptions. TamilSandhi adopts a modular and extensible architecture, facilitating ease of future enhancements and integration into broader Tamil NLP pipelines. Comprehensive validation has been conducted through an extensive test suite comprising 235 unit tests for addition rules and 65 unit tests for deletion rules, all included within the tests/ directory of the repository. All tests were successfully executed, demonstrating the correctness and stability of the rule-based transformations. TamilSandhi is freely available on GitHub and PyPI for public research, education, and development.
